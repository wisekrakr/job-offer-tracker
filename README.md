# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

React.js is a powerful and easy to learn library/framework to create beautiful styled user interfaces with the help of javascript.

Getting back to javascript and especially React.js,
after making a absolute monster of a web app https://github.com/wisekrakr/TeachWise (https://afternoon-brook-75246.herokuapp.com) a couple of years ago.

It's time to practice my React.js skills again. So I decided to start small as always and create a Job Offer Tracker. Basically a to-do list app, only with a few more features, no bells and whistles.

#### Usage
